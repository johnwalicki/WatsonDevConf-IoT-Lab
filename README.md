Topics covered: Raspberry Pi, Node-RED, Watson Internet of Things Platform, SenseHAT, Twitter, Sentiment and Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix.

In this lab, we will unbox and set up a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi SenseHat and connect to the IBM Bluemix and Watson IoT Platform.   We will query the temperature via the SenseHat and send data to the Watson IoT platform.  Watson IoT Platform will report the temperature and alert maintenance of a high temperature. Using Node-RED, running on the Raspberry Pi and in Bluemix, the application will analyze the sentiment of a Twitter feed.  The sentiment scores will be sent via Watsonâ€™s Internet of Things Platform service from a Node-RED application hosted on IBM Bluemix to the local Raspberry Pi. The SenseHAT LED display will flash a color corresponding to the sentiment. We will retrieve outside weather data and display it on a LED screen connected to the SenseHat.
